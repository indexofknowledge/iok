## Introduction

The CLI starts with the root repository [sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and guides to to the final repo according to your choices. It fetches Readme files of the repositories and parses them to create the select lists. So, the CLI needs a working network :). It also uses file caches to cache the Readme file contents. You can find the cache folder with name ".awsomecache" under your home folder.
