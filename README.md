# Index of Knowledge

> Tools to create curated collections of blockchain resources, on a blockchain

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rustielin/iok.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rustielin/iok)

The Index of Knowledge (IoK) project aims to provide tools for the creation of curated collections of resources. Resources and their corresponding topics are stored as a graph, allowing programmatic creation of front-ends, such as [interactive graph visualizations](https://index-of-knowledge.firebaseapp.com/?loaduser=rustielin.id.blockstack) as well as "awesome-lists", such as this README! The trick is in the data representation and traversal, e.g. grouped by topic and explored in order of pedagogical dependency. Users' IoK data are by default stored in Blockstack's Gaia distributed storage system, but otherwise pluggable with any other storage.
